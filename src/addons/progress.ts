   * - **Firefox**: Does not support request body streaming (request.body is not readable). Upload progress monitoring will not work.
   * - **Chrome/Chromium**: Requires HTTPS connections (HTTP/2). Will fail with `ERR_ALPN_NEGOTIATION_FAILED` on HTTP servers.
   * - **Node.js**: Full support for both HTTP and HTTPS.
   *
   * _Compatible with platforms implementing the [TransformStream WebAPI](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/TransformStream#browser_compatibility) and supporting request body streaming._
